"""The shared chart core has to stay identical across all six toolkit repos.

chart_style.py says CHART_BG, INK, GRID, SERIES_1 and apply_chrome() are the
same in every github.com/alexc-hue project-controls repo, with
project-controls-dashboard as the canonical copy. Each repo carries its own
file, so nothing enforced that until now: one repo was in fact missing
SERIES_1. This test pins the canonical values and a fingerprint of
apply_chrome(), and the same test runs in all six repos.

apply_chrome() is compared by its parsed syntax tree, so formatting and
comments don't matter but any change to what it does does. If the canonical
version changes on purpose, update APPLY_CHROME_FINGERPRINT here and in the
other five repos in the same pass.
